\section{Summary}

This report investigates the acoustic suitability of a new office development.
Firstly, it is done in terms of ductwork noise transmission between the plant room and conference room.
Secondly, it is be done in terms of sound transmission between the conference room and the adjacent single office, as there is concern that the speech may be audible in the office.

The investigation has consisted of the calculation of the noise ratings of the rooms, as well as the sound transmission and weighted standardised level difference between the rooms.

It has been deducted the the proposed design solution does not meet the client's needs, neither of a low background noise level in the conference room, nor of inaudibility of speech in the adjacent single office.
To rectify this, it has been subsequently recommended that the fan noise is controlled at the source (e.g. quieter fan) or along the path (e.g. stronger sound attenuator) to reduce background noise levels.
Moreover, it has been recommended that the standardised level difference between the rooms (particularly through the ductwork) be increased to ensure inaudibility of speech in the office.
This can be achieved by further attenuation of the ductwork between the conference room and single office (e.g. by the addition of a sound attenuator).
