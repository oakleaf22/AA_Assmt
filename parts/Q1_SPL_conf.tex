\section{Question 1}

\textbf{\textit{Calculate the sound pressure level in the conference room due to fan noise transmitted through the ductwork (both supply and return).}}


The resolution of the SPL in the conference room due to fan noise, L\textsubscript{p\textsubscript{1}}, will first be detailed at 63~Hz.
Afterwards, the results will be presented at all frequencies.


\subsection{Sound power level leaving the duct}

The sound power level leaving a duct is equal to the sound power level that entered the duct minus the sum of all attenuations (assuming all attenuations are positive) (see Equation \ref{eq:power}).

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:power}
		L_{W out} = L_{W in} - \Sigma Attn
	\end{equation}
	
In this question, L\textsubscript{W in} is the sound power level of the fan.
These values are provided in Table~1 of the assignment description.
