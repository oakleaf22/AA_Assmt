\section{Question 1}

\textbf{\textit{Calculate the sound pressure level in the conference room due to fan noise transmitted through the ductwork (both supply and return).}}


The resolution of the SPL in the conference room due to fan noise, L\textsubscript{p\textsubscript{1}}, will first be detailed at 63~Hz.
Afterwards, the results will be presented at all frequencies.


\subsection{Sound power level leaving the duct}

The sound power level leaving a duct is equal to the sound power level that entered the duct minus the sum of all attenuations (assuming all attenuations are positive) (see Equation~\ref{eq:power}).

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:power}
		L_{W out} = L_{W in} - \Sigma Attn
	\end{equation}
	
In this question, L\textsubscript{W\textsubscript{in}} is the sound power level of the fan.
These values are provided in Table~1 of the assignment description.
From the fan to the conference room, the fan noise is attenuated five times:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Within the sound attenuator
	\item Along the 15~m horizontal duct
	\item At the branch
	\item Along the 0.5~m vertical duct
	\item At the duct termination due to end reflection losses
\end{enumerate}

The attenuation provided by the sound attenuator are given in Table~5 of the assignment description.
The length attenuation of the horizontal and vertical ducts are calculated from values given in Table~4 of the assignment description in the following manner:
