\section{Question 2}

\textit{\textbf{Calculate the NR value of the conference room.}}

The background noise in the conference room is due to the fan noise transmitted through the ductwork (both supply and return).
Hence, the SPLs calculated in Question 1 have been plotted on the noise rating (NR) curve chart.
%in Figure 2.
As seen Figure \textbf{XYZ}, the conference room's NR value is 50.

\textbf{Is this worded correctly?}
