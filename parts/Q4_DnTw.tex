\section{Question 4}

\textbf{\textit{Calculate the weighted standardised level difference (D\textsubscript{nT,w}) between the conference room and single office for voice transmission through both the ductwork and the common partition, and discuss the results in terms of privacy.}}


The resolution of (D\textsubscript{nT,w}) between the conference room and single office for voice transmission through both the ductwork and the common partition is detailed and explained at 63~Hz in Sections~\ref{sec:4.1} to \ref{sec:4.3}.

\subsection{Step 1: Calculate D\textsubscript{nT}} \label{sec:4.1}

The first step is to calculate the standardised level difference, D\textsubscript{nT}, through the ductwork, through the partition, and through both the ductwork and the partition.
This is done using Equation~\ref{eq:DnT}.
Table~\ref{tbl:DnT_example} details the D\textsubscript{nT} calculations at 63~Hz and Table~\ref{tbl:DnT} presents the D\textsubscript{nT} results in octave bands between 63~Hz and 4~kHz.

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:DnT}
		D_{nT} = L_1 - L_2 + 10 log \frac{T_2}{0.5}
	\end{equation}

\subsection{Step 2: Calculate D\textsubscript{nT,w}} \label{sec:4.2}

The second step is to calculate D\textsubscript{nT,w} through the ductwork, through the partition, and through both the ductwork and the partition.
However, before we can do this, we need to extrapolate the third octave band values of D\textsubscript{nT}.
The extrapolation calculation is demonstrated in Table~\ref{tbl:DnT_extrapolation}.
